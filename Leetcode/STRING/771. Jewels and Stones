You're given strings jewels representing the types of stones that are jewels, and stones representing the stones you have. Each character in stones is a type of stone you have. You want to know how many of the stones you have are also jewels.

Letters are case sensitive, so "a" is considered a different type of stone from "A".

 

Example 1:

Input: jewels = "aA", stones = "aAAbbbb"

Output: 3

Example 2:

Input: jewels = "z", stones = "ZZ"

Output: 0

Solution C++:
class Solution {
public:
    int numJewelsInStones(string jewels, string stones) {
        unordered_map<char,int>m;
        int count=0;
        for(int i=0;i<jewels.size();i++)
        {
            m[jewels[i]]++;
        }
        //  for (auto i : m)
        // cout << i.first << "   " << i.second
        //      << endl;
        for(int i=0;i<stones.size();i++)
        {
            if(m[stones[i]]!=0)
            {
                count++;
            }
        }
        return count;
        
        
    }
};
